/**
 * Resolve provider API keys for a workflow run.
 *
 * Per-user keys (stored in Convex via the Settings page) take priority over
 * env-level fallbacks. Used by every API route that kicks off an LLM
 * workflow — they call this with the set of providers their run actually
 * needs, then pass the resulting `ProviderApiKeys` bag to the workflow
 * function.
 *
 * Why two Convex calls per resolve?
 * - `fetchQueryAsUser(users.getCurrentUser)` derives the userId from the
 *   request's auth JWT (proves who the caller is).
 * - `fetchQuery(apiKeys.getKeyForUserService, { _secret })` then reads the
 *   raw key string. This second call uses `requireService` so it ONLY
 *   accepts requests that present `WORKFLOW_SECRET` — the browser can't
 *   obtain that env var, so even an XSS payload using the user's JWT
 *   can't reach the key string. Without this split a `query` would be
 *   callable from any authenticated client.
